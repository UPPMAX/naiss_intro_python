# Functions

!!!- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Use a for loop
    - Write a function without an argument and without a return type
    - Write a function that calls a function
    - Write a function that requires an argument
    - Write a function with a return value

???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

    - Learners have used a for loop
    - Learners have written functions

    Lesson plan:

    - 5 mins: prior knowledge
    - 5 mins: presentation
    - 15 mins: challenge
    - 5 mins: feedback

    Prior:

    - What are functions?
    - Why use functions?
    - Can you name some Python functions?

## Overview

Sometime you need to do a same multi-line calculation multiple times in your code.
Instead of copy-pasting, one can use a so-called 'function'
to bundle a calculation is something that can be reused.

## Exercises

## Exercise 1: using a for loop
