# Reflection

- Date: 2025-11-27

Upon entering the Zoom room, I see that I am not a host. I asked
my colleague to do so. Not a nice start... I do trust her I will be
made host in time. On the other hand, I did prepare to move
the learners to my personal Zoom room: this will be bad, but I do
need those breakout rooms.

I enjoy how this day has unfolded: 
at the start there were 7 learners, of wich only 2 learners
are still in the course. The other 5 finished their exercises
and left. I think only 1 or 2 will come back after lunch to do Python,
as most either already know Python and 1 has 'just' done all the
Python exercises of the afternoon!

## 11:24

All learners have left... time to prepare my teaching for tomorrow until
13:00. Let's see how many show up then :-)
