# Reflection

Upon entering the Zoom room, I see that I am not a host. I asked
my colleague to do so. Not a nice start... I do trust her I will be
made host in time. On the other hand, I did prepare to move
the learners to my personal Zoom room: this will be bad, but I do
need those breakout rooms.
