# Reflection

- Date: 2025-11-27

Upon entering the Zoom room, I see that I am not a host. I asked
my colleague to do so. Not a nice start... I do trust her I will be
made host in time. On the other hand, I did prepare to move
the learners to my personal Zoom room: this will be bad, but I do
need those breakout rooms.

## 11:21

I enjoy how this day has unfolded:
at the start there were 7 learners, of wich only 2 learners
are still in the course. The other 5 finished their exercises
and left. I think only 1 or 2 will come back after lunch to do Python,
as most either already know Python and 1 has 'just' done all the
Python exercises of the afternoon!

## 11:24

All learners have left... time to prepare my teaching for tomorrow until
13:00. Let's see how many show up then :-)

I am happy how the morning went. What was new is that I allowed
the learners to work either alone or in groups.
1 out of 7 picked to work alone, the remaining 6 I gradually and
quickly put in breakout rooms.

I had enough time to talk to the learners. I encouraged them
to share their screens, so that I did not need to ask 'Where
are you (in the course material)?' all the time.
Because of the screen sharing, I am sure all learners did all exercises:
I've **seen** the Python interpreter, the Python scripts and the graphics.

One flaw was that I did not introduce my observer to the learners.
When all learners were in their rooms and I did a first round,
I had time to talk to her and discussed this. She apparently
had a question and helped out. She felt it was OK to help out
a bit and I trust her judgement. After the first break, I did introduce
her properly :+1: . I enjoy(ed) having an observer around: let's see
what she has written down :-)

At 11:37 a new learner came in. I brought her up to speed and this
felt OK: she did not turn her camera on, because she was ill, and that
was fine. She worked through the material in her own pace and she
is already experienced enough for this to go fast.

Although I was quite stressed at the start, the day unfolded gently.
The group of learners was a pleasure to work with!
