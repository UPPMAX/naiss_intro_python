## Reflection before looking at evaluation results

- I had one colleague that I said to treat as a regular learner, but I
  failed: I did treat him like something between TA and learner
- I missed being helped the first hour, because I felt I talked too much
- One group of 3 ended up in, indeed,
  2 people being active and 1 being passive :-)
- Also I cannot keep up a full day. And I think that helps us understand
  what the learners feel
- I let them go earlier, as this was the fastest group ever
- I did not let them do functions: I feel it is beyond the scope of
  this course
- I should add if-statements and for-loops: those are more basic concepts
