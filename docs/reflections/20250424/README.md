## Reflection before looking at evaluation results

- I had one colleague that I said to treat as a regular learner, but I
  failed: I did treat him like something between TA and learner
- I missed being helped the first hour, although there were some colleagues
  available. I did not ask for help, because I felt I had talked too much:
  it was at 9:17 that we started doing exercises
- One group of 3 ended up in, indeed,
  2 people being active and 1 being passive :-)
- Also I cannot keep up a full day. And I think that helps us understand
  what the learners feel
- I let them go earlier, as this was the fastest group ever
- I did not let them do functions: I feel it is beyond the scope of
  this course
- I should add if-statements and for-loops: those are more basic concepts


## Feedback Linus

- What went well?
    - All students went through all of the important things
        - RB: definitely!
    - Sending more advanced Python students home was a good thing;
      they came there for the HPC part
        - RB: agree
    - Exercises and material is very good

- What are features of the course?

    - Some learners get lost in the book (it's a good book),
      doing exercises on their own

- What could be improved?

    - Students that already know Python could be sent back home earlier
        - RB: agree, at 11:00 we could let the first people go :-)
    - Some learners do the exercises in the book and then forget about
      the course material.
        - RB: agree: remove the mention of the exercises in the book
          and sent them to the exercises in the course material (only)
