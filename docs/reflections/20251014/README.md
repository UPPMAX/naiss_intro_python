## Before teaching

The 'Hello little turtles' session took me too much time to get
to get to work. After one hour, I think it is better if this
session starts in a remote desktop environment (ignoring X forwarding).

- [ ] Schedule at 4 hours to fix 'Hello little turtles'
- [ ] Consider to do so for 'Graphics' instead
- [ ] Add one of these to the morning sessions schedule
- [ ] Update goal: to be able to run a Python script on an HPC cluster,
  that runs a graphical library

## Morning session

I clearly marked the two different parts of the day.
This part had a clear end goal: to be able to run a Python
script on an HPC cluster.

I did feel there were too many Priors in it.

- [x] Remove the parts about the 3 types of bugs

With a clear end goal in mind, I sent the faster workers back earlier.

- [ ] Make more explicit: when done, we go home. When working together,
  we will go home sooner

I enjoyed working with this group.

## Afternoon session

This session had a goal, but it could have been
clearer: to be able to read/write a variable from/to a file.

- [ ] Make goal of second half clearer:
  to be able to read/write a variable from/to a file

Also, the session was too cut up.

- [ ] Merge sessions 'Variables, expressions and statements'
  into 1 page

Also, there were useless intermediate goals.

- [x] Remove useless intermediate goals

Also, there were mentions of HPC cluster doc.

- [x] Remove needless mentions of HPC cluster doc in the LOs

Also, TOCs of pages were too deep: make exercises of type header 2.

- [x] make exercises of type header 2

In this part of the day, I sent learners back home earlier.
It felt OK.

I enjoyed working with this group, including the new additions:
they blended in well.

The end of my day was weak: I was mentally exhausted.
