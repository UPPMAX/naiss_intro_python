## Before teaching

The 'Hello little turtles' session took me too much time to get
to get to work. After one hour, I think it is better if this
session starts in a remote desktop environment (ignoring X forwarding).

- [ ] Schedule at 4 hours to fix 'Hello little turtles'
- [ ] Consider to do so for 'Graphics' instead
