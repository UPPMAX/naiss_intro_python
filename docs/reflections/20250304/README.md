## Reflection before looking at evaluation results

The day went reasonably well, with some sloppinesses:

- Forgot to tell what to do when done

Even though I thought I prepared well, this is work needed:

- Make [Modules and Python packages](sessions/hello_little_turtles.md)
  NAISS wide
- Improve [Command line arguments](sessions/command_line_arguments.md)
- Improve [Graphics](sessions/graphics.md)
- Improve [Functions](sessions/functions.md)

These sessions should be merged:

- Merge [The way of the program](sessions/the_way_of_the_program.md)
  and [Working with Python scripts](sessions/working_with_python_scripts.md)  
- Merge [Variables, expressions and statements: operators](sessions/variables_expressions_and_statements_2.md)  
  and [Variables, expressions and statements: user input](sessions/variables_expressions_and_statements_3.md)

This day, I was helped by a colleague. This seemed useful in the first hour,
as there were many unknowns. At the first break, however, the dust
had already settled and I let the colleague go back to work again.

!!! info "Half of the registered learners showed up"

There were 63 registrations, of which 2 are cancellations
done by email. In the first hour, there were 32 learners,
hence around 50% of the registrations showed up.

!!! info "Half of the learners showing up had access to a NAISS cluster"

In the first hour, a third of the learners droppen out:
they had no acccess to a NAISS cluster after all.
From the remaining learners, around 8 out of around 24
had no access either, yet used a local Python instead.
This means that 1/3 + (1/4 * 2/3) = 50% did not have access
to a NAISS cluster.

Due to the sloppy course material ('It is not worth your time'),
I started the evaluation at 14:45 already
and at 15:10 all learners were gone. I think this is the right
reaction and next time, I will make sure the rest of the course material
is at the same level of quality. No idea how I missed that!

I enjoyed working with the group. I was suprised again,
how eager most learners are when helping each other.

I'd rate this day a narrow pass: the teaching itself was reasonable,
yet the course materials were not ready.

## After evaluations

Let's look for the weakest session:

question|mean|reflection
---|---|---
I am comfortable using the Python book|4.2667|.
I am comfortable using the documentation of my HPC center|4|.
I can convert a simple equation to Python code|4.2667|.
I can convert a simple text question to Python code|4.066|.
I can create a Python script|4.33|.
I can load a Python version on my HPC cluster|4.33|.
I can login to my HPC cluster|4.4667|.
I can run a Python script|4.4|.
I can use a text editor on my HPC cluster|4.2667|.
In Python| I can ask a user for input|3.93|.
In Python| I can create a file|3.93|.
In Python| I can create a variable|4.53|.
In Python| I can find and use the operator for exponentiation|4.53|.
In Python| I can use a variable|4.53|.
In Python| I know what the modulo operator is and when to use it|4.2|.
In Python| I can read a file|3.8|.
In Python| I can use user input in a calculation|3.8|.
I can describe what the Python programming language is|3.8|.
I am comfortable learning Python|3.8|This is my teaching score
I can describe what the Python interpreter is|3.734|Maybe add a picture here
I can describe what a program is|3.6|Weakest learning objective. It can be removed
.        |.                                |.  |.
In Python| I can use command-line arguments|1.4|Agree: was not taught
In Python| I can write a function that requires an argument|1.06667|Agree: was not taught
In Python| I can write a function with a return value|1.333|Agree: was not taught
In Python| I can write a function without an argument and without a return type|0.86667|Agree: was not taught
I can find and use a Python module on Rackham|1.66667|Agree: was not taught
In Python| I can write a function that calls a function|1|Agree: was not taught
In Python| I can import the matplotlib library|1.2|Agree: was not taught
In Python| I can use a for loop|1.8|Agree: was not taught

My teaching score is the confidence for 'I am comfortable learning Python',
which is 3.8 out of 5, is 7.2 out of 10. A 7.2 for me it is!

The weakest session is 'I can describe what a program is': I removed
it, as it is not important.

The outcome 'I can describe what the Python interpreter is' is next but
lowest: I need to crate an image somewhere.
