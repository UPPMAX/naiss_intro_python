## Reflection before looking at evaluation results

The day went reasonably well, with some sloppinesses:

- Forgot to tell what to do when done

Even though I thought I prepared well, this is work needed:

- Make [Modules and Python packages](sessions/hello_little_turtles.md)
  NAISS wide
- Improve [Command line arguments](sessions/command_line_arguments.md)
- Improve [Graphics](sessions/graphics.md)
- Improve [Functions](sessions/functions.md)

These sessions should be merged:

- Merge [The way of the program](sessions/the_way_of_the_program.md)
  and [Working with Python scripts](sessions/working_with_python_scripts.md)  
- Merge [Variables, expressions and statements: operators](sessions/variables_expressions_and_statements_2.md)  
  and [Variables, expressions and statements: user input](sessions/variables_expressions_and_statements_3.md)

This day, I was helped by a colleague. This seemed useful in the first hour,
as there were many unknowns. At the first break, however, the dust
had already settled and I let the colleague go back to work again.

!!! info "Half of the registered learners showed up"

There were 63 registrations, of which 2 are cancellations
done by email. In the first hour, there were 32 learners,
hence around 50% of the registrations showed up.

!!! info "Half of the learners showing up had access to a NAISS cluster"

In the first hour, a third of the learners droppen out:
they had no acccess to a NAISS cluster after all.
From the remaining learners, around 8 out of around 24
had no access either, yet used a local Python instead.
This means that 1/3 + (1/4 * 2/3) = 50% did not have access
to a NAISS cluster.

Due to the sloppy course material ('It is not worth your time'),
I started the evaluation at 14:45 already
and at 15:10 all learners were gone. I think this is the right
reaction and next time, I will make sure the rest of the course material
is at the same level of quality. No idea how I missed that!

I enjoyed working with the group. I was suprised again,
how eager most learners are when helping each other.

I'd rate this day a narrow pass: the teaching itself was reasonable,
yet the course materials were not ready.
