## Reflection before looking at evaluation results

The day went reasonably well, with some sloppinesses:

- Forgot to tell what to do when done

Even though I thought I prepared well, this is work needed:

- Make 'Modules and Python packages'
  NAISS wide
- Improve 'Command line arguments'
- Improve 'Graphics'
- Improve 'Functions'

These sessions should be merged:

- Merge 'The way of the program'
  and 'Working with Python scripts'
- Merge 'Variables, expressions and statements: operators'
  and 'Variables, expressions and statements: user input'

This day, I was helped by a colleague. This seemed useful in the first hour,
as there were many unknowns. At the first break, however, the dust
had already settled and I let the colleague go back to work again.

!!! info "Half of the registered learners showed up"

There were 63 registrations, of which 2 are cancellations
done by email. In the first hour, there were 32 learners,
hence around 50% of the registrations showed up.

!!! info "Half of the learners showing up had access to a NAISS cluster"

In the first hour, a third of the learners dropped out:
they had no access to a NAISS cluster after all.
From the remaining learners, around 8 out of around 24
had no access either, yet used a local Python instead.
This means that 1/3 + (1/4 * 2/3) = 50% did not have access
to a NAISS cluster.

Due to the sloppy course material ('It is not worth your time'),
I started the evaluation at 14:45 already
and at 15:10 all learners were gone. I think this is the right
reaction and next time, I will make sure the rest of the course material
is at the same level of quality. No idea how I missed that!

I think the Mermaid graphs are more in the way, as opposed
to being helpful. Remove these

- [ ] Remove the mermaid plots

I enjoyed working with the group. I was surprised again,
how eager most learners are when helping each other.

I'd rate this day a narrow pass: the teaching itself was reasonable,
yet the course materials were not ready.

## After evaluations

Let's look for the weakest session:

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

- My teaching score is the confidence for 'I am comfortable learning Python',
  which is 3.8 out of 5, is 7.2 out of 10. A 7.2 for me it is!
- The weakest session is 'I can describe what a program is': I removed
  it, as it is not important.
- After that, the outcome 'I can describe what the Python interpreter is' is
  next but lowest: I need to create an image somewhere :-)

- [ ] Add an image to show what an interpreter does


Texts:

- I have been following during the morning only.
  It was very nicely arranged,
  and I have appreciated the interactive exercise solving sessions
  (despite not having camera and mic).
  I will go on studying python from the book on the website!

This is great to hear! I am happy to hear that using a book is appreciated
by the learners.

- I thought i fulfilled the prerequisites but i apparently [didn't].
  I thought the NAISS SUPR account was the account needed but it [wasn't].
  I could therefore not participate in the course.
  It would be nice if the prerequisites was formulated more clearly.

This is unfortunate. I think it was clearly described and I would describe
this more prominently if I would continue the course like this. However,
the course will change, with a SNIC project being used by all learners.
Let's hope next time such feedback can be avoided :-)

- I would have been happy to continue during the last hour as well!
- It would have been fun to do the remaining pages as well,
  or at least one more as we had another hour.

I am happy to see the learners wanted more. But the material was not
up to par with my quality standards. It would have been a gamble to
continue. In any case, next course iteration, I make sure all is
up to par, so to avoid this feedback in the future :-)

- The instructor is great, motivated, and interactive,
  which makes sure each participant understand each step.
  For me, the best part of this course was to let me practice [HPC]
  and run simply code. This practice removed the fear to start using [HPC].
  I was afraid if I do something wrong while I am logging into [HPC]
  and mess up there.
  I absolutely recommend others to take this course if they have not.

Wow, that is great to hear!

- Could you suggest a resource for further learning?

I agree with this feedback. I abruptly ended the course, without
providing this. I will deliver next course iteration :-)

- [ ] Add a 'Further learning' session

- I do not feel like we have learned to do what is mentioned in the 7 last
  questions, but I suppose I will be able to find out how to do those.

This is correct: the course material there is not up to par with
my quality standards yet.

- Really nice intro to Python!
  RichelÂ´s teaching style is very interactive and open,
  there is no need to feel scared to ask questions or give wrong answers.
  I like the breakout rooms, since it gives the possibility to engage
  more with other learners, and help each other out.
  The course is adjusted to the speed of the participants,
  so no one is rushed during the exercises.
  I think it's a good idea to base the course on a book,
  so we can keep on learning more in our own time afterwards,
  especially since the book includes exercises.  

Yay!

- I really enjoyed this course.
  I particularly enjoyed how interactive it is,
  and how Richel was able to put everyone at ease and
  create the perfect environment for interactions.
  Even though some of the material was maybe a bit too basic
  for my level of knowledge,
  the questions asked by Richel are a perfect way to get everyone
  to think more in depth about their knowledge,
  and reflect on how you could explain those concepts to someone
  else if you ever find yourself in that situation.
  I would have appreciated it if the course went slightly further
  into the introduction to python,
  but on the other end I do feel confident that
  I can do it on my own now.
  Thank you for the great work.

Lovely to hear this!

## Email

An email I got afterwards:

```text
Dear Richel,

Thanks for the wonderful course. I, unfortunately, have to attend another meeting in the later half of the day and cannot continue to attend the course session. I will fill out the evaluation form.

Thank you and best wishes, 
[name of learner]
```

Thanks!

## Success score

Per request of NAISS, I've added a number: the success score,
which is the average confidence in the learning outcomes.
Treat with caution `[Fenwick, 2001]`!
