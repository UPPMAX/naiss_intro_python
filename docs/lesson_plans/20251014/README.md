## 2025-10-13

I have only this day to prepare. Yet, the material is in a good
state, so that will work.

Let's first go through the last reflections:

- [ ] Encourage colleagues to be absent
- [x] Let learners add the cluster name to their Zoom name, else write it down
- [ ] Make the later material Good
- [x] Show better when HPC is done and Python-only starts
- [ ] Add 'Be able to write simple Python scripts'
  as the goal of the Python-only part
- [ ] Add Python package modules
- [ ] Assume variables are understood well enough
- [ ] Spend a bit more time on text editors
- [x] Create breakout rooms that fit the learners
