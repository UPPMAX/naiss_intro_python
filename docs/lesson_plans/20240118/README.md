- Intro to Python, day 4 of the 'Intro to UPPMAX' course
- Teacher: Richel
- Day: Thursday 2024-01-18

Teaching goals:

- Learners have used the UPPMAX documentation
- Learners have used a free and online book they can use for future reference
- Learners have loaded Python using the module system
- Learners have used the Python interpreter
- Learners have used command-line arguments as input
- Learners have read a file
- Learners have written to a file
- Learners have created a plot, e.g. a scatter plot
- Learners feel that Python is something they can do
- Learners work in small groups
- Learners have enough breaks
- Practice to use the fundamental teaching cycle (as discussed in
  Mike Bell's 'The Fundamentals of Teaching': (1) prior knowledge,
   (2) presentation, (3) challenge, (4) feedback, (5) repetition

Non-goals:

- Discuss as many Python concepts as possible,
  instead follow the group's pace
- Stick to the schedule about Python theory,
  instead follow the group's pace
- Practice Python theory enough to master it,
  instead follow the group's pace
- Tailor to advanced Python developers,
  instead follow the beginners' pace
  and let the more advanced learners help
- Teach best practices,
  instead show those best practices
- Use teaching materials developed by colleagues just to be nice.
  Instead, use free-online teaching materials developed by others,
  so that me and my colleagues do not need to maintain it

Negative feedback that I will enjoy and not respond to:

- 'The course goes too slow': this is an introduction, aimed at beginners.
  The more advanced learners inevitably will find it go too slow.
- 'Lectures are too short' or 'The contents should be taught':
  strategic learners will prefer passive listening
  over active teaching methods. Although listening is an activity that
  strategic learners appreciate,
  it has a too small effect for transferring knowledge.
  I will not feel sorry for putting my learners to work :-)
- 'Go more in-depth': this is an introduction, aimed at beginners,
  so I cover the basics and we get stuff to run. I will go as deep as time
  permits me.
- 'Breaks interrupt the flow': I agree it does. Still, breaks are
  important. And if you feel interrupted in a flow, it is nice to feel
  you like to continue

Negative feedback that I will respond to:

- 'The course goes too fast': this is an introduction, aimed at beginners.
  If even the beginners need more time, I must slow down

Negative feedback that I will not enjoy and not respond to:

- 'Chaotic': this is nonsense. Judging by the preparation, its is a
  well-prepared student-paced day.
- 'We want regular lectures'. I practice what the literature tells me
  what is most effective. I won't feel bad for doing what I
  is most/more effective
