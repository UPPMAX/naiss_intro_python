## 2025-11-24

I will have my colleague Sahar observing this day, so I will prepare
are bit more explicitly.

However, first I start with items from
[the previous reflection](../../reflections/20251014/README.md):

- [ ] Schedule at 4 hours to fix 'Hello little turtles'
- [ ] Consider to schedule 4 hours to fix 'Graphics' instead
- [ ] Add one of these to the morning sessions schedule
- [x] Update goal: to be able to run a Python script on an HPC cluster,
      that runs a graphical library
- [x] Make more explicit: when done, we go home. When working together,
      we will go home sooner
- [x] Make goal of second half clearer:
      to be able to read/write a variable from/to a file
- [ ] Merge sessions 'Variables, expressions and statements'
      into 1 page
- [x] Put in non-goals: 'do complex Python'
- [x] Refer to HPC Python course more
- [ ] Think on how to implement this, i.e. work more independently instead of
  in a group
- [ ] Think on how to implement to make exercises more collaborative,
  e.g. let them write their own code (as a group) based on the book?
