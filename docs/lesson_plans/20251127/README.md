## 2025-11-24

I will have my colleague Sahar observing this day, so I will prepare
are bit more explicitly.

However, first I start with items from
[the previous reflection](../../reflections/20251014/README.md):

- [ ] Schedule at 4 hours to fix 'Hello little turtles'
- [ ] Consider to schedule 4 hours to fix 'Graphics' instead
- [ ] Add one of these to the morning sessions schedule
- [x] Update goal: to be able to run a Python script on an HPC cluster,
      that runs a graphical library
- [x] Make more explicit: when done, we go home. When working together,
      we will go home sooner
- [x] Make goal of second half clearer:
      to be able to read/write a variable from/to a file
- [ ] Merge sessions 'Variables, expressions and statements'
      into 1 page
- [x] Put in non-goals: 'do complex Python'
- [x] Refer to HPC Python course more
- [ ] Think on how to implement this, i.e. work more independently instead of
  in a group
- [ ] Think on how to implement to make exercises more collaborative,
  e.g. let them write their own code (as a group) based on the book?

Also:

- [ ] Allow the faster learners to skip the simpler chapter(s) of the book

## 2025-11-25

Taking a look at the course content, the book seems to slow the learners
down:

- [The Way of The Program](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/sessions/the_way_of_the_program/)
  seems slow
- [Hello, little turtles](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/sessions/hello_little_turtles/)
  feels childish
- [Graphics](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/sessions/graphics/) is
  unfinished yet promising

Lets update the schedule:

- First session goal: run Python on HPC
- Second session goal: run a Python script on HPC
- Third session goal: run a Python script with something graphical on HPC

I note that this still follows all the same learning outcomes,
except for using a book; but that one is used after 12:00.
The things after 12:00 I delay preparing for now.

Status:

- Introduction: needs to be checked
- First session goal: good, has video
- Second session goal: good, needs video
- Third session goal: needs work, needs video

My goal is to focus on beginners. 
This means that if the evaluation results state
that the course went too slow, I am happy. 
This means that if the evaluation results state
that the course went too fast, I am unhappy.




## Observation questions

### Observation of first hour

This day, I want to experiment using variable group sizes,
where people are allowed to decide in a group of 1 or 2-3.
How do you think that that worked out?

- Was this setup clearly explained?
- Did I do what I promised regarding this setup?
- If I see that something can be improved, was this reasonable judgement
  that was communicated well enough?
- Would you judge that this setup is to be preferred over
  random assignment of 2-3 people in each room?

### Observation of fourth hour

This day, I want to experiment letting the more experienced
Python users work on things at their level.
How do you think that that worked out?

- Was this setup clearly explained?
- Did I do what I promised regarding this setup?
- If I see that something can be improved, was this reasonable judgement
  that was communicated well enough?
- Would you judge that this setup is to be preferred over
  all following the same basic theory?
