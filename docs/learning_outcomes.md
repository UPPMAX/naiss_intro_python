# Learning outcomes

This course is aimed at complete beginners.

??? question "What does this mean?"

    That we follow the pace of the group as a whole
    (i.e. not of those that are fastest, nor the sessions in the schedule)

    Additionally, this means that if a learner writes in the evaluation
    'This course was too slow', this is considered neutral.
    If a learner writes in the evaluation
    'This course was too fast', however, this is considered **bad**.

Below are the learning outcomes of this course,
as copied from [its evaluation](evaluation.md).
The course is learner-centered ([why?](faq.md#why-is-the-course-learner-centered)),
hence the pace is determined be the learners (i.e. not by the clock).

These are the two main goals:

Time     |Main goal
---------|--------------------------------------------------
Morning  |To be able to run Python code on an HPC cluster
Afternoon|To be able to write your first Python code

You can be reasonably sure you'll achieve this:

- I am comfortable using the documentation of my HPC center
- I am comfortable using the Python book
- I am comfortable learning Python
- I can load a Python version on my HPC cluster
- I can describe what the Python interpreter is
- I can use a text editor on my HPC cluster
- I can create a Python script
- I can run a Python script
- I can run a Python script that uses a graphical library on an HPC cluster
- In Python, I can create a variable
- In Python, I can use a variable
- I can convert a simple equation to Python code
- In Python, I can find and use the operator for exponentiation
- In Python, I know what the modulo operator is and when to use it
- I can convert a simple text question to Python code
- In Python, I can write text to a file

Here are the rest of the learning outcomes, each item being less and less
likely to be discussed:

- In Python, I can ask a user for input
- In Python, I can use user input in a calculation
- I can find and use a Python module on my HPC cluster
- In Python, I can read a file
- In Python, I can create a file
- In Python, I can use command-line arguments
- In Python, I can import the `matplotlib` library
- In Python, I can use a for loop
- In Python,
  I can write a function without an argument and without a return type
- In Python, I can write a function that calls a function
- In Python, I can write a function that requires an argument
- In Python, I can write a function with a return value

These are non-goals:
