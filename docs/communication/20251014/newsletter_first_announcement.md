This 1-day course helps you get started with Python,
by working ourselves through an online and free book.
Although the focus is on learning Python,
we do work in an HPC environment
and you will be taught the bare minimum
to run Python on an UPPMAX HPC cluster.
The pace of this highly interactive course
is set by the majority of learners,
ensuring that any complete beginner
has enough time for exercises.
At the end of the day, you should feel comfortable with the basics
of Python and feel familiar to a book on Python to help you on your next steps.
