## Welcome to the Intro to Python course of 2025-10-14

Dear learners,

Welcome to the 'Intro to Python' course of 2025-10-14!

Well done! You've already done one of the four prerequisites (as listed on <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/prereqs/> ):

- [x] Prerequisite 1/5: You have registered at our registration form
- [ ] Prerequisite 2/5: You have registered at SUPR
- [ ] Prerequisite 3/5: You have accepted access to the NAISS course project
- [ ] Prerequisite 4/5: You are able to login to an interactive session (e.g. SSH) on your HPC cluster
- [ ] Prerequisite 5/5: You have a good Zoom setup

Now get ready for the hardest prerequisites: number 4. This can take multiple days, to: (1) register at SUPR, (2) get an invite to the course project, and (3) log in to that HPC cluster.

Help, answers and videos can be found at the course's FAQ page at <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/faq/#prerequisites> .

The course assumes:

- you can log in to an HPC cluster
- the documentation of that cluster is helpful

If you have any questions, never hesitate to contact me.

Please make sure you've done all your prerequisites and if yes, see you on October 14th 9:00 (sharp!) at the Zoom room below this email.

Thanks and cheers, Rich√®l Bilderbeek, NAISS 'Intro to Python' main teacher
