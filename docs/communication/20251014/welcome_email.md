## Welcome to the 'Intro to Python for HPC' course of 2025-10-14 step 2

Dear learners,

Welcome to the 'Intro to Python for HPC' course of 2025-10-14!

Well done! You've already done one of the five prerequisites (as listed on <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/prereqs/> ):

- [x] Prerequisite 1/5: You have registered at our registration form
- [ ] Prerequisite 2/5: You have registered at SUPR
- [ ] Prerequisite 3/5: You have accepted access to the NAISS course project
- [ ] Prerequisite 4/5: You are able to login to your HPC cluster
- [ ] Prerequisite 5/5: You have a good Zoom setup

Next step is step 2. Please register at SUPR at https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/ 
and/or send me the email you have registered yourself with at SUPR.

Help, answers and videos can be found at the course's FAQ page at <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/faq/#prerequisites> .

The course assumes you can log in to an HPC cluster, so let's make that work :-)

If you have any questions, never hesitate to contact me.

Please make sure you've done all your prerequisites and if yes, see you on October 14th 9:00 (sharp!) at the Zoom room below this email.

Thanks and cheers, Richèl Bilderbeek, NAISS 'Intro to Python for HPC' main teacher
