This 1-day course lets you write and run Python code on an HPC cluster.
The goal of the first half of the course,
is to run Python on an HPC cluster,
with little focus on the Python language itself.
The goal of the second half of the course,
is to learn the basics of Python
and can be done from your local computer as well.
The pace of this highly interactive course
is set by the majority of learners,
ensuring that any complete beginner
has enough time for exercises.
At the end of the day, you should feel comfortable with writing and running
Python code on either HPC or your local computer.
