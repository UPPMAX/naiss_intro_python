## Welcome to the Intro to Python course of 2025-03-04!


```text
Dear learners,

Welcome to the 'Intro to Python' course of 2025-03-04!

Well done! You've already done one of the four prerequisites (as listed on [https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/prereqs/](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/prereqs/):

- [x] Prerequisite 1/4: You have registered at our registration form at here
- [ ] Prerequisite 2/4: A user account on a Swedish academic HPC cluster
- [ ] Prerequisite 3/4: Be able to login to an HPC cluster using SSH
- [ ] Prerequisite 4/4: have a good Zoom setup

Now get ready for the hardest prerequisite: number 3. This can take multiple days, to: (1) get such a project (2) log in to that HPC cluster.

Help, answers and videos can be found at the course's FAQ page at [https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/faq/#prerequisites](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/faq/#prerequisites). 

The course assumes you can log in to an HPC cluster and that the documentation of that cluster's documentation is clear (if not, contact your cluster's HPC center).

If you have any questions, never hesistate to contact me.

Please make sure you've done all your prerequisites and if yes, see you on March 4th 9:00 (sharp) at Zoom room `[room]` with password `[password]`.

Thanks and cheers, Rich√®l Bilderbeek, NAISS 'Intro to Python' main teacher
