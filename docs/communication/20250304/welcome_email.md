## Welcome to the Intro to Python course of 2025-03-04

Dear learners,

Welcome to the 'Intro to Python' course of 2025-03-04!

Well done! You've already done one of the four prerequisites (as listed on <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/prereqs/> ):

- [x] Prerequisite 1/4: You have registered at our registration form at here
- [ ] Prerequisite 2/4: A user account on a Swedish academic HPC cluster
- [ ] Prerequisite 3/4: Be able to login to an HPC cluster using SSH
- [ ] Prerequisite 4/4: have a good Zoom setup

Now get ready for the hardest prerequisite: number 3. This can take multiple days, to: (1) get such a project (2) log in to that HPC cluster.

Help, answers and videos can be found at the course's FAQ page at <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/faq/#prerequisites> .

The course assumes:

- you can log in to an HPC cluster
- the documentation of that cluster is helpful (if not, contact your cluster's HPC center).

If you have any questions, never hesitate to contact me.

Please make sure you've done all your prerequisites and if yes, see you on March 4th 9:00 (sharp!) at the Zoom room below this email.

Thanks and cheers, Rich√®l Bilderbeek, NAISS 'Intro to Python' main teacher
