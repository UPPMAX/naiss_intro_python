## Reminder to Intro to Python course of 2025-03-04

Dear learners,

Again, welcome to the 'Intro to Python' course of 2025-03-04!

I've prepared videos on how to login and how to start Python
on these HPC clusters:

- Alvis
- Bianca
- COSMOS
- Dardel
- Kebnekaise
- Rackham
- Tetralith

If your favorite HPC cluster is missing, you are encouraged to contact me and I will happily add answers/documentation/videos for your cluster.

If you have any questions, never hesitate to contact me.

Please make sure you've done all your prerequisites and if yes, see you on March 4th 9:00 (sharp!) at the Zoom room below this email.

Thanks and cheers, Rich√®l Bilderbeek, NAISS 'Intro to Python' main teacher
