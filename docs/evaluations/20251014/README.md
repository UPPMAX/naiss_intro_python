## Feedback

From [anonymous_feedback.txt](anonymous_feedback.txt):

- Very well designed and beginner friendly training!
- A very nice basic Python course for beginners
  who want to start using Python on HPC.
  The course website is very informative and tidy. Thanks a lot!

From [survey_end.csv](survey_end.csv):

- On the whole I feel the course was good, just not on the right level for me.
  However, the materials for the 4-day course
  (https://uppmax.github.io/HPC-python/index.html)
  led me to some more advanced stuff: automatic code optimization with Numba,
  and indirectly to automatic parallelization with DECO.
- Very nice course for the Python beginner!
- Great course, beginner-friendly!
- Overall, it was a good course for complete beginners.
  However, it would have been nicer to have more discussion
  and less independent reading.
  Much of the material from the Python book could have been replaced
  by direct (faster) explanations from the instructor,
  followed by group discussions and more strictly collaborative exercises.
  This approach would likely have led to faster and more effective learning.
- Since there are already plenty of Python tutorials available online,
  a course like this should focus on being more interactive rather
  than being a space where to work independently through existing materials.
  I also would have appreciated covering some more essential
  yet slightly advanced topics—such as functions, available python packages,
  and similar concepts—instead of spending as much time on very basic material,
  like simple arithmetic with operators.
