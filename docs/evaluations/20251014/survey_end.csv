However, the materials for the 4-day course (https://uppmax.github.io/HPC-python/index.html) led me to some more advanced stuff: automatic code optimization with Numba, and indirectly to automatic parallelization with DECO.

Much of the material from the Python book could have been replaced by direct (faster) explanations from the instructor, followed by group discussions and more strictly collaborative exercises. This approach would likely have led to faster and more effective learning.

Since there are already plenty of Python tutorials available online, a course like this should focus on being more interactive rather than being a space where to work independently through existing materials. I also would have appreciated covering some more essential yet slightly advanced topics—such as functions, available python packages, and similar concepts—instead of spending as much time on very basic material, like simple arithmetic with operators."
