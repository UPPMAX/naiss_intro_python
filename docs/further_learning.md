# Further learning

At the end of this day, you should feel comfortable to learn Python.

These are possible next steps:

- [The NAISS HPC Python course](https://uppmax.github.io/HPC-python):
  will allow you to run heavier calculations using more advanced Python
  packages
- [The Programming Formalisms course](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/)
  teaches how to do programming well, according to the practices in the
  literature
