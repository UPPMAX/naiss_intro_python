As a learner, it can be assuring to know you have registered.
Here are the registrations we've received,

    - `timestamp`: the timestamp in `DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss`
      format
    - `email`: the MD5 hash of the email address

## Number of registrations in time

- Data: [n_registrations_in_time.csv](n_registrations_in_time.csv)
- Code: [plot_n_registrations_in_time.R](plot_n_registrations_in_time.R)
    - `date`: the date, in `DD/MM/YYYY` format
